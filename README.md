Testing with Selenium
Selenium is an open source umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting browser automation. It provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests across most modern web browsers, without the need to learn a test scripting language.

MockMvc is defined as a main entry point for server-side Spring MVC testing. Tests with MockMvc lie somewhere between between unit and integration tests. They aren't unit tests because endpoints are tested in integration with a Mocked MVC container with mocked inputs and dependencies.

JUnit is a Java unit testing framework that's one of the best test methods for regression testing. An open-source framework, it is used to write and run repeatable automated tests. As with anything else, the JUnit testing framework has evolved over time.
